# AoC

Advent of Code solutions, implemented in Haskell. This is my first exposure to
Haskell, so it will be interesting to have a look at these implementations
again once I gain a bit more experience with the language. Programs take the
input on `stdin`, and output the answers to puzzle A and B on two separate
lines on `stdout`.

For any particular day, the corresponding (example) input is provided. To run a
solution, for example for the puzzle from day 1:

```
cat day1.txt | runhaskell day1.hs
```
