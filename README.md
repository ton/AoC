# AoC

Advent of Code solutions, implemented in Haskell. Programs take the input on
`stdin`, and output the answers to puzzle A and B on two separate lines on
`stdout`.

For any particular day, the corresponding (example) input is provided. To run a
solution, for example for the puzzle from day 1:

```
cat day1.txt | runhaskell day1.hs
```
